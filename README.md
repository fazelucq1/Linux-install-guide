## Introduction

Switching to Linux may seem daunting if you‚Äôve never used an open-source operating system. In reality, most modern distributions (called ‚Äúdistros‚Äù) offer guided installers, intuitive interfaces, and a vast community ready to help.  

**Goals of this guide:**  
- Show you how to prepare a USB stick with a Linux ISO.  
- Walk you through each installation screen, from boot to first login.  
- Provide official links to the most popular distros so you can pick what suits you best.  
- Help you configure your system after installation (drivers, software, etc.).  

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Who is this guide for?**  
> - Absolute beginners who have only used Windows/macOS.  
> - Anyone seeking a more stable, secure, and customizable OS.  
> - Students or professionals needing an open-source environment (programming, graphics, servers, etc.).  

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:  

1. **A PC with an SSD or Hard Disk**  
   - If it‚Äôs a new PC, confirm you have at least one drive bay (SATA or NVMe).  
   - If you‚Äôre dual-booting with Windows, back up any important data first.  

2. **A USB stick of at least 4 GB**  
   - Recommended: 8 GB or larger, to accommodate heavier distros.  
   - Note: all data on the USB stick will be erased when you make it bootable.  

3. **An Internet connection**  
   - Needed to download the ISO and, later, updates and drivers.  

4. **Another computer (or the same one) to create the USB stick**  
   - It can be running Windows, macOS, or a different Linux.  

---

## Downloading the ISO and Creating a Bootable USB

### 1. Downloading the ISO

1. Choose the distribution you prefer (see [‚ÄúMost Popular Linux Distributions‚Äù](#most-popular-linux-distributions) below for details).  
2. Go to the distro‚Äôs official website (links provided later) and download the ISO file. It usually lands in your `Downloads` folder.

> üìù Example: For Ubuntu, visit https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop and click ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù under the LTS (Long Term Support) version.  

---

### 2. Preparing the USB Drive

#### 2.1 Windows: Rufus

1. Download Rufus from https://rufus.ie/ and run it (no installation required).  
2. Insert your USB stick into a free USB port.  
3. In ‚ÄúDevice,‚Äù select your USB stick.  
4. Under ‚ÄúBoot selection,‚Äù click ‚ÄúSELECT‚Äù and choose the ISO you just downloaded.  
5. Leave all other options at default (File system: FAT32).  
6. Click ‚ÄúSTART‚Äù and confirm any warnings (data will be erased).  
7. Wait for the process to finish.

> *Example of Rufus configuration on Windows.*  

---

#### 2.2 macOS: balenaEtcher

1. Download balenaEtcher from https://www.balena.io/etcher/.  
2. Install and launch balenaEtcher.  
3. Insert your USB stick into a USB port.  
4. Click ‚ÄúFlash from file‚Äù and select the ISO.  
5. Choose your USB stick as the target.  
6. Click ‚ÄúFlash!‚Äù and wait for the writing to complete.  
7. Once done, safely eject the USB stick.  

---

#### 2.3 Linux: `dd` or balenaEtcher

- **With balenaEtcher**: Same steps as on macOS.  
- **With `dd` (terminal method)**:  
  1. Open a terminal.  
  2. Identify the USB device:  
     ```bash
     sudo lsblk
     ```  
     Look for the line matching your USB stick (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).  
  3. Run the following command (replace `/dev/sdX` with the correct device name, without a number; e.g., `/dev/sdb`):  
     ```bash
     sudo dd if=/path/to/your/iso-file.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
     ```  
  4. Wait for it to finish (no need to ‚Äúeject‚Äù‚Äî`dd` writes everything before exiting).  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** If you choose `dd`, double-check your target device. Writing to the wrong disk will permanently erase its data.

---

## BIOS/UEFI Configuration

To boot from the USB stick, you must access your PC‚Äôs BIOS/UEFI settings:

1. **Power on/restart** your PC.  
2. During the initial splash screen, press the key to enter BIOS/UEFI (often `F2`, `F10`, `F12`, `DEL`, or `ESC`, depending on the manufacturer).  
3. In the BIOS/UEFI interface:  
   - **UEFI Mode**: find the ‚ÄúBoot‚Äù or ‚ÄúBoot Order‚Äù section.  
   - Move ‚ÄúUSB‚Äù or ‚ÄúRemovable Devices‚Äù to the top of the list.  
   - If ‚ÄúSecure Boot‚Äù is enabled, disable it (modern distros often support Secure Boot, but turning it off is safer for installation).  
4. Save changes (usually `F10`) and reboot.

## Installing Linux on SSD/Hard Disk

### 1. Booting from USB

1. With the USB stick plugged in, power on the PC. You should see the Linux live environment or installer menu (wording varies by distro, e.g., ‚ÄúTry Ubuntu without installing,‚Äù ‚ÄúStart Fedora Live,‚Äù etc.).  
2. Most installers give you two main options:  
   - **Try the distro in Live mode** (no installation, just a test).  
   - **Install directly** (e.g., ‚ÄúInstall Ubuntu,‚Äù ‚ÄúInstall Fedora‚Äù).  
3. We recommend selecting ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù right away so you can proceed with the installation steps.

---

### 2. Partitioning and Formatting

Exact steps differ slightly between distros, but the principles are identical:

1. **Language**: choose your preferred language (e.g., English).  
2. **Time zone**: usually detected automatically.  
3. **Keyboard layout**: select ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù or whichever layout you use.  
4. **Installation type**:  
   - **Standard installation** (recommended for beginners): the installer automatically creates partitions (root, swap, home).  
   - **Manual partitioning** (for advanced users or dual-boot scenarios): you can create:  
     - `/` (root) ‚Äì at least **20 GB**, formatted as ext4.  
     - `/home` (user data) ‚Äì as large as you want (e.g., the rest of the disk), formatted as ext4.  
     - `swap` ‚Äì at least equal to your RAM if you want hibernation, otherwise half your RAM is sufficient.  
5. Select the target drive (SSD or Hard Disk).  
6. Confirm: **WARNING**: This will erase all data on the chosen disk if you overwrite it.

> *Example of manual partitioning with LVM on Ubuntu.*  

---

### 3. Basic Installation

1. **Create your user**: enter your name, computer name (hostname), and a password.  
2. **Install GRUB**: the bootloader that lets you pick between Linux and other OSes (if dual-booting).  
3. Click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù to begin the copy/install process.  
4. Wait for completion: depending on your hardware and distro, this can take 5‚Äì20 minutes.

> ![Installation Complete](images/04-install-success.webp)  
> *Once finished, you‚Äôll be prompted to reboot.*  

5. **Reboot** without the USB stick inserted (remember to eject it).  
6. You‚Äôll see the GRUB menu on startup, which will load Linux by default.

---

## Post-Installation: Initial Setup

### 1. Updating the System

Open a terminal and run the following commands, depending on your distro:

- **Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint/Pop!\_OS**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

* **Fedora**:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf upgrade --refresh -y
  ```
* **Manjaro (Arch-based)**:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Syu
  ```

---

### 2. Installing Additional Drivers

1. **NVIDIA/AMD graphics**:

   * On Ubuntu/Mint/Pop!\_OS, use ‚ÄúAdditional Drivers‚Äù (Software & Updates ‚Üí ‚ÄúAdditional Drivers‚Äù tab).
   * On Fedora:

     ```bash
     sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia       # for NVIDIA
     sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-amdgpu  # for AMD
     ```
   * On Manjaro:

     ```bash
     sudo mhwd -a pci nonfree 0300  # automatically installs NVIDIA drivers
     ```
2. **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth**: usually detected automatically. If your network doesn‚Äôt work, search for the proprietary package (e.g., `broadcom-sta-dkms` on Debian/Ubuntu).

---

### 3. Essential Software

Below are some recommended packages (adjust according to your needs):

* **Web Browsers**:

  * `firefox` (preinstalled on many distros)
  * `chromium` or `google-chrome-stable`

* **Terminal Tools**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install build-essential git curl wget vim      # for Debian-based
  sudo dnf install @development-tools git curl wget vim   # for Fedora
  sudo pacman -S base-devel git curl wget vim              # for Manjaro
  ```

* **PDF Reader**:

  * `evince`, `okular` or `xreader`.

* **Office Suite**:

  * `libreoffice`.

* **Multimedia Codecs** (some distros don‚Äôt include them by default):

  * Ubuntu/Mint/Pop!\_OS:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras
    ```
  * Fedora:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install rpmfusion-free-release-tainted
    sudo dnf groupupdate multimedia --setop="install_weak_deps=False" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin
    ```

* **Graphics Editors**:

  * `gimp`, `inkscape`, `krita`.

* **Virtualization** (optional):

  * `virtualbox`, or `kvm` + `virt-manager`.
